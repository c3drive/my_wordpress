Visualize is a minimalist two-column theme that places equal emphasis on text and images.

== Description ==
Visualize is a minimalist two-column theme that places equal emphasis on text and images. Perfect for pairing poetry with photography, illustrations with essays, or showcasing mixed-media works, Visualize features a clean and simple design showcasing an elegant layout. 

The dramatic site header on the front page features a full-screen video or image of your choice, with three beautiful photo header options included with the theme. Add a custom logo, your site title and tagline, and a menu to round out the header, or dive right into the two-column content.

Your content takes center stage with the two-column layout used for all posts and pages, as well as in comment areas. Add widgets to the footer to incorporate additional functionality into your site.

Visualize also integrates with Jetpack, offering additional features including infinite scroll and extra widgets. Visualize is optimized for any size of screen, ensuring that visitors can enjoy your content on their device. Visualize showcases your content through a simple and unique design, providing a site experience that your visitors are sure to enjoy.

1. Go to the Customizer (Appearance -> Customize) to select your header image, and to customize widgets, menus and more.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Setting Featured Images =
The featured image should be set using the featured image option rather than inserting the image into the content editor. If desired, you may still put images into the post content in addition to the featured image or gallery. If no featured image is set, the theme will automatically search through your post content for an image to feature. If there are no images there, the fallback image (configurable in the Customizer) will be used as needed.

= Blurry/Small Featured Image =
If your featured images are displaying blurry, try using the "Regenerate Thumbnails" plugin to reset your image sizes. Also make sure that the uploaded image is at least 950x900 pixels.

= Slow Loading, Featured Image Sizes, and Retina Support =
After extensive testing, featured image display had been optimized to maximize image quality while minimizing loading time. Images are automatically sized to 950x900 pixels on upload, but the full size image is available when users click the full sized image button, giving users access to higher quality versions. Even with this optimization, users on slower internet connections may experience unavoidable delay in images loading for certain posts.

= Images Cut Off =
Because the images column of the theme layout is designed to fill the entire space with the image, images will be cropped depending on the screen size. An alternative option to show the entire image with added whitespace may be made available in the future based on user feedback.
